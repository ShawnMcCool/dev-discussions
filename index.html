            <h1>About</h1>
<p>Have you ever noticed that there is a wealth of information for beginner developers, but it can be much more difficult to obtain helpful knowledge as you advance? Come hang out with us!</p>
<p>We are a group dedicated to openly discussing software development techniques.</p>
<p>Our core mission is to question the status quo and forever seek improvement. We believe that this can only be accomplished if we respect the following tenets.</p>
<ul>
<li>We expect one another to behave in a professional manner.</li>
<li>Everyone is welcome. We must be always aware that other people have different experiences and needs than we do and accept this diversity as the positive value that it can be.</li>
<li>We must strive to better understand the perspectives and techniques of others, for this is how we grow.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Please Join Us. You are welcome.</h1>
<p>We can be found in #dev-discussions on irc.freenode.net. Come chat with us. There are no prerequisites. If you can behave respectfully, we would love to chat with you.</p>
<h1>Videos</h1>
<p>We have published some videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsTWLmFQ6CneW43wFxxFvATlvoB8a7o7s">our YouTube Channel</a> and intend to continue doing so.</p>
<h1>Additional Information</h1>
<p>This page was created with Couscous. More information can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ShawnMcCool/dev-discussions">our Github repo</a>.</p>
