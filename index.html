            <h1>About</h1>
<p>Dev Discussions is a movement trying to make public the thoughts of developers as they seek to improve their knowledge. The information generated should not be considered authoritative.</p>
<ul>
<li>We expect one another to behave in a professional manner.</li>
<li>Everyone should be welcome. We must be always aware that other people have different experiences and needs than we do and accept this diversity as the positive value that it can be.</li>
<li>We must strive to better understand the perspectives of others, for this is how we grow.</li>
<li>In addition, we must strive to question the status quo and be forever seeking improvement. This is our core purpose.</li>
</ul>
